# Comment Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to comments throughout the Lox interpreter codebase.

## Goals
- Remove outdated or redundant comments
- Add clear, concise documentation for all public methods
- Explain complex algorithms and design decisions
- Provide context for language-specific features (inheritance, closures, super)

## Files Updated

### Core Files
- **interpreter.hpp**: Added comprehensive documentation for all visitor methods, explaining the purpose and behavior of each language construct
- **LoxFunction.hpp/cpp**: Documented function binding, closure capture, and method execution
- **main.cpp**: Clarified command-line interface and execution phases
- **Resolver.hpp**: Added documentation for scope resolution and variable binding

### Key Improvements
1. **Method Documentation**: Every public method now has a clear docstring explaining its purpose
2. **Architecture Comments**: Added explanations for complex systems like environment chains and method binding
3. **Edge Case Documentation**: Special attention to tricky features like super in closures
4. **Error Handling**: Documented error conditions and return codes

## Documentation Philosophy
- Comments explain **why**, not just **what**
- Focus on concepts that aren't obvious from the code
- Highlight connections between different parts of the system
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs

## README.md
Created comprehensive documentation including:
- Complete Lox grammar specification
- Architecture overview with component descriptions
- Usage examples for all language features
- Build and usage instructions
- Technical implementation details
- Testing information

## Result
The codebase now serves as both a working interpreter and an educational resource, with clear explanations for anyone studying interpreter implementation or the Lox language.
